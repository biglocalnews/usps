## Development

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for managing packages.
Make sure you have this installed, with node-v18.

### Getting started

After installing `yarn`, run:

```zsh
# Install dependencies
yarn install --dev
```

### Running the development server

The live-reload dev server can be run with:

```zsh
yarn dev
```
